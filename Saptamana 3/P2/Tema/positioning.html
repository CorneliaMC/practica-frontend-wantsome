    <section>This defines a flex container; inline or block depending on the given value. It enables a flex context for
        all its direct children.</section>
    <section><b>flex-basis</b>: this defines the default size of an element before the remaining space is distributed.
        It can be a length (e.g. 20%, 5rem, etc.) or a keyword. The auto keyword means "look at my width or height
        property" (which was temporarily done by the main-size keyword until deprecated). The content keyword means
        "size it based on the item's content" - this keyword isn't well supported yet, so it's hard to test and harder
        to know what its brethren max-content, min-content, and fit-content do.</section>
    <section><b>flex-direction</b> : the four possible values of flex-direction being shown: top to bottom, bottom to
        top, right to left, and left to right. </section>

    <footer> If you use a fixed header, make sure there is room for it!</footer>
